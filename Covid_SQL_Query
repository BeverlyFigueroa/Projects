--This is my SQL work with data from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths dataset from Our World In Data (http://https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
--
--I first take a look at the data as a whole. I am working with 2 different files: Covid_Deaths and Covid_Vaccinations:

SELECT *
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths`

SELECT *
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Vaccinations`

--Next, I will select the data I will use. 
--I use the WHERE command to screen out data by region, as I only want to look at countries:

SELECT 
  location, date, total_cases,new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2

--Here I am looking at Total Cases vs Total Deaths.
--It shows the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID in your country:

SELECT
  location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, 
  (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS Death_Percentage
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths`
WHERE continent is not null
ORDER BY 1,2

--Here we are looking at the Total Cases vs Population
--It shows what percentage of the population got Covid in the US:

SELECT
  location, date, population, total_cases, 
  (total_cases/population)*100 AS Population_Infected_Percentage
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
AND location = 'United States'
ORDER BY 1,2

--Here I am looking at Countries with the Highest Infection Rate, compared to the Population:

SELECT
  location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS Highest_Infection_Rate, 
  MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS Population_Infected_Percentage
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY Population_Infected_Percentage DESC

--This is showing Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population:

SELECT
  location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS Total_Death_Count
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY Total_Death_Count DESC

--Now we can break it down by Continent
--Showing Continents with Highest Death Count per Population:

SELECT
  continent, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS Total_Death_Count
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY Total_Death_Count DESC

--We can also look at the Global Numbers
--My SUM wasn't working because new_deaths was a float, so I had to CAST as an integer:

SELECT
  SUM(new_cases) AS Total_Cases, 
  SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int)) AS Total_Deaths,
  SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int))/SUM(new_cases)*100 AS Death_Percentage
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2

--I will now join my two datasets (Covid_Deaths and Covid_Vaccinations)
--We are using a rolling count that increases by day to look at Total Population vs Vaccinations per day:

SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations as int)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS Rolling_People_Vaccinated
FROM `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Deaths` dea
JOIN `stoked-monitor-351301.Covid_Project.Covid_Vaccinations` vac
  ON dea.location = vac.location
  AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2,3

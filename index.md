### Biography

I currently work in the healthcare field for a hospital system in Arizona, and have worked remotely for the past 10 years as a Certified Professional Coder. I decided I was ready for a new challege and, because I've always had a passion for computers, decided I wanted to go into programming. I currently am studying for my Associates in Computer Science at Weber State University. 

### About Me

I am a highly motivated individual with a great work ethic with excellent analytical and problem-solving skills. I have continuously demonstrated initiative in researching and resolving intricate issues and I have become an asset to my department by demonstrating competency in my specialty, while becoming well-respected among my peers. I exercise good judgment and am able to maneuver in a complex and rapidly changing work environment. I am able to quickly retain new information in order to meet deadlines and productivity standards set by my manager. I am able to work collaboratively and flexibly in a growing department. I am capable of working, planning, researching, and conducting projects independently. I am efficient at organizing and prioritizing workloads to manage multiple tasks with exceptional attention to detail. I am able to create and update reference materials, as well as communicate effectively (both orally and in writing), in both English and Spanish.

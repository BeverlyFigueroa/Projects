### Biography

I recently finished the Data Analytics course given by Google Creative Campus. I have been working in the Healthcare field for 10 years as a Certified Professional Coder. I decided I wanted to try a new challege and chose Data Analytics because I have worked with computer programming in the past, as well as graphic design, so I thought this would be a good marriage between all the skills I have.

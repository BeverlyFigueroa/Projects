I am efficient at organizing and prioritizing workloads to manage multiple tasks with exceptional attention to detail. I am able to create and update reference materials, as well as communicate effectively (both orally and in writing), in both English and Spanish.

I have experience identifying project objectives and design scope. I have created project plans that have outlined the tasks, timelines, and resources required for project completion. I have communicated with the project team, ensuring that milestones were met while managing customer expectations.
